# Project-one-Hangman
I'm creating the word guessing game Hangman.

The game will select a random word from a list and the
user will get a few chances to guess the word, one letter at a time before time runs out. 

If the user guesses all the letters of the word correctly, they win!
If th euser runs out of guesses before guessing the word, they lose!
